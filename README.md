First when the person open the laptop he will have to show his face. If he tries to hide his face for any reason, he will not able to login as the login button will be activated only when his face is visible. When his face is detected his picture will be captured and saved in a folder named “archived”, if the internet is not working. If the internet is working then it will be mailed to a person whose email-id will be given in the CSV file and that picture will be moved to another folder named “thiefphoto”. 2. Secondly, if the person would enter a wrong password then his picture will be captured and sent to the person if internet is working.
